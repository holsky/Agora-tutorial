==============

This is a node.js tutorial based on the Agora application. We want to add the facility for a blog post. I already prepared many of the helper functionalities and tests, so you can focus on solving the problem of using node.js asynchronous calls properly.

1. The steps to set up the application can be found here: http://www.github.com/softwerkskammer/Agora

2. The tutorial can be found here: TODO
